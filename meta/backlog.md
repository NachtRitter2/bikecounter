# Project Backlog
This is a home for tasks that are ready to be implemented, but not ready to be added to the issues queue. Tasks are put in the backlog when a user story from the Project Roadmap (roadmap.md) is decomposed into tasks, but those tasks cannot be completed in parallel with the tasks in the issues queue. This file is managed by the Code for Sacramento core team, and pull requests on this file are not accepted. If you are interested in joining the core team, please come to a [meetup](http://www.meetup.com/code4sac/) or drop us an [email](mailto:hello@codeforsacramento.org)!
