# Mockups
These mockups attempt to depict the limited set of user-facing states of a minimally functional BikeCounter release.

## Counter Screen

### Start
This screen is designed to record bike traffic through an intersection. A rider passing through an intersection is described by an "entry leg", an "exit leg", and rider's gender.

### One rider

### Two riders, same gender
If multiple riders travel the same route, the "gender" buttons act as accumulators.

### Three riders, different genders
Riders of different gender travelling the same route can be recorded together.

### Select an entry leg
Choose an entry leg that will apply to all riders indicated. The entry leg may be selected before, during or after the gender selection/accumulation process.

### Select an exit leg
Choose an exit leg that will apply to all riders indicated.

### Autosave
Choosing an exit leg triggers a save.

### Complete
Once the save is complete, the user is notified. The user can optionally delete the newly-saved record, until they enter a new entry leg, or indicate a new rider.
