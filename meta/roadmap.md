# Project Roadmap
The project roadmap is a series of user stories describing the eventual functionality of the application. User stories will be marked with italics when they are added to the backlog, and with a strikethrough when they are implemented. Pull requests are happily accepted on this file, but they should reflect discussions about the roadmap in the issues queue.

1. As a SABA volunteer, I want to easily record bicycle traffic at an intersection so that data is usable by [SABA](http://sacbike.org/) and the [NBPD](http://bikepeddocumentation.org/).
2. As SABA, we want to be able to easily access and process data generated by bike count volunteers so that we can better understand how to make Sacramento more bike-friendly.
